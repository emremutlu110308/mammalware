# MammalWare
MammalWare is a malware dataset which consist of nearly 450k Windows 32-bit executable files (years 2020-2022) from 477 malware families.
Two distinct datasets in terms of sample numbers and malware families were generated from the MammalWare.
We called them as MammalWare_Small and MammalWare_Medium.
MammalWare-Small has 15k malware samples from 15 families.
MammalWare-Medium has 85k malware samples from 15 families.
Rest of malware samples in MammalWare were not used because of our normalisation efforts regarding the sample numbers.

The original executable files and the their json data gathered from VirusTotal can be requested from Middle East Tehcnical University.

The dataset is created within the thesis study of Emre MUTLU.
The study is mainly about the "Malware Family Classification with Deep Learning"
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and transfer learning models (VGG19 and ResNet152) are applied on MammalWare-Small and MammalWare-Medium.

Scripts in the scripts folder are created for dataset creation purposes such as downloading, filtering, transferring etc.

Deep learning codes are mainly based on a prior study of Prajapati and Stamp.
