MamMalware is malware dataset which consist of nearly 450k Windows 32-bit executable files (years 2020-2022).
Two distinct datasets in terms of sample numbers and malware families were generated from the MamMalware.
We called them as MamMalware-Small and MamMalware_Medium.
MamMalware-Small has 15k malware samples from 15 families.
MamMalware-Medium has 85k malware samples from 15 families.
Rest of malware in MamMalware were not used because of our normalisation efforts regarding the sample numbers.
We shared only input formats of two datasets as gray-scale images and opcode sequences.
The original executable files and the their json data gathered from VirusTotal can be requested from Middle East Tehcnical University.
The dataset is created within the thesis study of Emre MUTLU.
The study is mainly about the "Malware Family Classification with Deep Learning"
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and transfer learning models (VGG19 and ResNet152) are applied on M
